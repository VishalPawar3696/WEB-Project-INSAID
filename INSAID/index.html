            Education is a purposeful activity directed at
             achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of 
            understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty.

            Education is commonly subdivided into different
             types. The most common subdivision is between formal, non-formal, and informal education.[35][36][7][37] However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and informal education.[38] A process of teaching constitutes formal education if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework. Such frameworks are usually chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which have different classes based on the student's age and progress,
             all the way from primary school to university.

            Programs at ISCED level 2, lower secondary
             education are usually organized around a more subject-oriented curriculum; differing from primary education. Teachers typically have pedagogical training in the specific subjects and,
             more often than at ISCED level 1

            Informal learning is one of three forms of 
            learning defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared 
            relationships among members of society
